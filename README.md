# UET_System
The Unemployment Tracking System is a Java based application made to make job posting, training program administration, and job searching more efficient for the unemployed people. The goal of this project is to give the three main user groups—administrators, employers, and job seekers—an easy-to-use platform. Role-based access is used by the system to guarantee that every user has the resources necessary to achieve their objectives. 

Objectives:
•	To assist job seekers in finding relevant job opportunities and training programs.
•	To enable employers to post job listings and training programs efficiently.
•	To allow administrators to manage user accounts, job postings, and training programs.

Features:
1.	User Registration and Login:
o	Users can register as a Job Seeker, Employer, or Admin.
o	A secure login system verifies user credentials before granting access.
2.	Job Seeker Features:
o	Search for jobs based on title or required skills.
o	View available training programs to enhance skills.
3.	Employer Features:
o	Post job listings with details such as title, description, skills required, location, and salary.
o	Post training programs specifying program details, trainer, and location.
4.	Administrator Features:
o	View and manage all registered users.
o	Review all job postings and training programs.
o	Oversee system-wide operations to ensure compliance and efficiency.
5.	Data Persistence:
o	User, job, and training program data is stored in text files (users.txt, jobs.txt, trainings.txt) to maintain data integrity across sessions.

Technology Stack:
•	Programming Language: Java
•	Data Storage: Text files for persistent storage
•	Development Tools: Any IDE supporting Java, such as VSCode, NetBeans or Online Java Compiler.
Benefits:
•	For Job Seekers:
o	Access to a centralized platform to search for jobs, apply for jobs and training programs.
o	Opportunities to upskill through relevant training programs.
•	For Employers:
o	Simplified job posting process to attract talent.
o	Ability to share training programs for skill development.
•	For Administrators:
o	Full control over user accounts and content moderation.
o	Insights into system usage and operations.
Proposed Workflow:
1.	User Registration:
o	Users select their role and provide necessary details (name, email, password, etc.).
o	Data is stored securely in the system.
2.	Login:
o	Users log in with their credentials to access personalized features.


3.	Role-Specific Menus:
o	Job Seekers: Search for jobs, view training programs.
o	Employers: Post jobs, post training programs.
o	Admins: Manage users, jobs, and training programs.
4.	Data Management:
o	Data for users, jobs, and training programs is read from or written to text files when necessary.
Expected Outcomes:
•	A user-friendly platform facilitating employment and skill development.
•	Streamlined job posting and training program creation for employers.
•	Efficient management of users and content by administrators.

Future Scope:
1.	User Management: Password recovery, profile updates, and multi-factor authentication.
2.	Job Seekers: Job alerts, application history, and skill recommendations.
3.	Employers: Applicant tracking and job analytics.
4.	Advanced Jobs: Filters, auto-expiry, and better job matching.
5.	Training: User enrollment and certification.
6.	Scalability: Database integration and web/mobile app support.


Conclusion:
The Unemployment Tracking System is an innovative solution to help job seekers connect with opportunities, empower employers, and provide administrators with tools to manage the platform effectively. This project will not only simplify these processes but also create an ecosystem of growth and collaboration.
