# UET_System
The Unemployment Tracking System is a Java based application made to make job posting, training program administration, and job searching more efficient for the unemployed people. The goal of this project is to give the three main user groups—administrators, employers, and job seekers—an easy-to-use platform. Role-based access is used by the system to guarantee that every user has the resources necessary to achieve their objectives. 

Objectives:
•	To assist job seekers in finding relevant job opportunities and training programs.
•	To enable employers to post job listings and training programs efficiently.
•	To allow administrators to manage user accounts, job postings, and training programs.

Features:
1.	User Registration and Login:
o	Users can register as a Job Seeker, Employer, or Admin.
o	A secure login system verifies user credentials before granting access.
2.	Job Seeker Features:
o	Search for jobs based on title or required skills.
o	View available training programs to enhance skills.
3.	Employer Features:
o	Post job listings with details such as title, description, skills required, location, and salary.
o	Post training programs specifying program details, trainer, and location.
4.	Administrator Features:
o	View and manage all registered users.
o	Review all job postings and training programs.
o	Oversee system-wide operations to ensure compliance and efficiency.
5.	Data Persistence:
o	User, job, and training program data is stored in text files (users.txt, jobs.txt, trainings.txt) to maintain data integrity across sessions.

Technology Stack:
•	Programming Language: Java
•	Data Storage: Text files for persistent storage
•	Development Tools: Any IDE supporting Java, such as VSCode, NetBeans or Online Java Compiler.
